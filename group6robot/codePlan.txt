Task List Overview
	Startup
	Read colours
	Generate algorithm
	Reformat moves
	Solve Cube
	Shutdown

Task Breakdown
	Startup
		Reset/Calibrate sensors and motors
		Move basket to "perpendicular"/"zero" orientation
		Move puller to "standard"/"zero" position
		Move lifter to "down"/"zero" position
		
		Prompt for next file to exec
		Prompt user to insert Cube
		Prompt to confirm successful startup
	
	Read Colours
		Display scan order (of face)
		Write each cell to array
		Verify that the colours were read correctly (via array)
		Write array to file
		
		Display current cell being read
		Prompt to confirm that face has been ready correctly, and give option(s) as for what to change
		UI for modifying individul incorrectly read cells (changing one or more incorrectly read cells on the face)
	
	Generate Moves (on laptop)
		Bring file into an array
		Verify that array does indeed represent a cube (9 cells of each color, etc.)
		Convert array into format that the ALGORITHM requires
		Run ALGORITHM
		Convert ALGORITHM output to a sequence of usable "move" instructions
		Convert moves into motor rotations
		Writes sequence of motor rotations to output file
		
		More error checking of cube (no identical edges, vertecies, or centres, etc.)
		Estimate time to solve based on number of moves
	
	Solve Cube
		Receives file with motor rotations
		Turns motors according to file
		Between all basket rotations, confirms that basket is perpendicular (within tolerance)
		Starts timer
		
	Shutdown
		Reset basket orientation
		Reset flipper position
		Reset lifter position
		Turn off all motors
		Close all files
